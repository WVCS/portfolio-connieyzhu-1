  <h2> English Translation </h2>
  <dl>
  <dt> Pinwheel </dt>
  <dd> <pre>I waited for you
From far away
Cold wind keeps blowing
A very small pinwheel
Just blanking standing there
Looking so lonely as if it's looking for someone
Felt like I was looking at me

Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that's why we grew apart
Feels like I'm making it up so I have no faults
So I can't say that
I'm just facing the wind

In the future
So I won't be sorry
I want to always be waiting
That makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it's far ahead in the future

People only see the outside
And ask if the wind is cold
They just ask and pass by
Why ask if you're gonna forget anyway?
Feels like wind from you
So without a word, I'm just waiting

Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that's why we grew apart
Feels like I'm making it up so I have no faults
So I can't say that
I'm just facing the wind

In the future
So I won't be sorry
I want to always be waiting
That makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it's far ahead in the future

Feels like time has hidden
And taken you too
Can't I see you?
Sometimes, I get bad thoughts
I start to forget you

But don't cry
It may seem sad
But I'm here
For you

Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it's far ahead in the future</dd>
<dl>
<dt>Smile Flower</dt>
<dd> <pre> For some reason, sometimes, suddenly
I keep thinking these days
How happy I am, how beautiful you are
About us, who is second to none
If we ever become unhappy
Some day
If we become apart
What do I do?
Of course, that won't happen

I don't even wanna think about this
But sometimes I do
I hope you don't

I can smile because we're together
I can cry because it's you
So what can't I do?
Whenever, wherever
Even if we're not together, just like always
Our smile flowers bloom
I'll be the spring to your smile

I always
Only receive from you
So I'm so thankful and sorry
To the point of tears
I wanna hug you
But I feel nervous for some reason
Why am I hesitating?
I don't wanna be like this

Just like the sky is high and the wind is cold
Like the ocean is wide and blue
I'm afraid that
I'll take you for granted
I think that's why I'm being like this
I'm nervous about that
What if I lose you?
I hope you don't feel the same

I can smile because we're together
I can cry because it's you
So what can't I do?
Don't say it's the end
Forever
Because I'll stay by your side

Whatever happens
Just like always, we'll be together

Don't say it's the end
Forever
Whatever happens, just like always
Our smile flowers will bloom

Whenever, wherever
Even if we're not together, just like always
Our smile flowers bloom
I'll be the spring to your smile</dd>
